      "\n",
      "We have seen some built-in Python functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- `print()`\n",
      "- `len()`\n",
      "- `open()`\n",
      "\n",
      "And some methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "- `.read()`\n",
      "- `.write()`\n",
      "- `.upper()`\n",
      "- `.replace()`\n",
      "\n",
      "An important difference is that **functions** like print don't belong to any particular object - if we want to print something we just write `print()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods** always belong to an object - if we want to convert a string to upper case we can't just write `upper()` - we have to write `something.upper()`. \n",
      "\n",
      "Methods only work on the right type of thing - we cannot call `.read()` on a string or a number, and we cannot call `.replace()` on a file.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Describing functions\n",
      "\n",
      "What do we need to know about a function in order to use it? Input and output. E.g. `len()`:\n",
      "\n",
      "- input is a string\n",
      "- output is a number that tells us the length of the string\n",
      "\n",
      "How about `open()`?\n",
      "\n",
      "- input is a string that is the name of a file, and a string that is the mode (reading, writing, appending, etc)\n",
      "- output is an object representing the file\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful function for bioinformatics would be a FASTA formatter. Let's make up a name: `format_fasta()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- input is a string that is the name of the sequence, and a string that is the DNA sequence\n",
      "- output is a string that represents that sequence in FASTA format\n",
      "\n",
      "This function doesn't exist in Python, but if it did, then we could do something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "    output_file = open('output.fasta')\n",
      "    output_file.write(format_fasta('ABC123', 'actgatcgatcgatcgatcgactagctagctacgtagctag'))\n",
      "\n",
      "and when we looked at the output file we would see\n",
      "\n",
      "    >ABC123\n",
      "    actgatcgatcgatcgatcgactagctagctacgtagctag\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###Defining new functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's define the `format_fasta` function so that we can use it in our scripts. This is how we define a function:\n",
      "\n",
      "    def format_fasta(name, sequence):\n",
      "        fasta_string = '>' + name + \"\\n\" + sequence + \"\\n\"\n",
      "        return fasta_string\n",
      "\n",
      "The definition is made up of several parts\n",
      "\n",
      "- we start by writing `def` which stands for _define_\n",
      "- next we write the name of the function we are defining\n",
      "- next we write a list of the arguments (inputs) in brackets\n",
      "- this line ends with a colon\n",
      "- then we write the code that we want to run, which uses the arguments\n",
      "- the code that will be run is indented \n",
      "- finally, we write `return` and then the value we want to return (the output)\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay close attention to the indentation as this is the first example we've seen. In general, we indent lines when we want to indicate that they belong together in some way. A group of indented lines is often called a **block**. The lines in a function are grouped together because they are the lines that make up the function. Later on in the course we will see examples of different types of blocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important at this stage to be clear about the difference between **defining** a function and **calling** it. These are two completely separate operations. Defining a function like in the code above does not cause the code to be run - it simply tells Python what to do when it _is_ eventually run. Calling the function means actually using it, and it's at this point that the code in the block will be excecuted.\n",
